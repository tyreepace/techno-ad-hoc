## My Comments

- I just followed what was asked for in the Ad Hoc assignment without changing any of their tests or the requirements. The main sticking point with that was then not being able to return a total count or page number in the response headers which I tend to prefer when dealing with pagination. Also, I stuck with just using vanilla js instead of implementing a framework which would have done all this work for me behind the scenes.

## Setup

**Requirements:** NodeJS > 4, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

`yarn install` to install.

`yarn test` to run the provided unit tests.
